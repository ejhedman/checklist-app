## Overview

### Purpose

The Release Management Checklist App helps engineering teams plan, track, and complete software releases by maintaining a structured checklist that captures **who** must do **what** by **when**. It keeps a continuous timeline of past and future releases, always surfacing the *next* scheduled release so teams know exactly what requires attention.

### Scope

#### In Scope (v1.0)
- Web application (desktop-first, responsive design)
- User and team management
- Release and feature tracking
- Readiness status monitoring
- Role-based access control
- Basic auditing and activity tracking
- Real-time updates
- JIRA ticket integration

#### Out of Scope (v1.0)
- Automated CI/CD integrations
- Email/Slack notifications and alerts
- API rate limiting and advanced security
- Mobile-native clients
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Custom workflow configurations

### Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Reduce missed release tasks | % releases reaching ready status ≥24h before target date | ≥90% |
| Single source of truth | % release artifacts captured in app | 100% |
| Ease of onboarding | Time for new user to complete profile & join team | <5 minutes |
| System reliability | Uptime percentage | ≥99.5% |
| Performance | Time to First Byte (TTFB) for authenticated pages | <200ms |

## Business Rules & State Logic

### Release State Definitions

| State | Definition | Color Code | Action Required |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **pending** | Earliest release with target_date ≥ today AND not ready/complete/cancelled | Yellow (bg-yellow-300) | Teams need to complete tasks |
| **ready** | Pending release AND all readiness criteria met | Green (bg-green-500) | Ready for deployment |
| **past_due** | Pending release AND target_date < today AND not ready | Red (bg-red-500) | Immediate attention required |
| **complete** | Manually set by release manager when deployed | Blue (bg-blue-500) | None (archived) |
| **cancelled** | Manually set by release manager | Gray (bg-gray-200) | None (archived) |

### State Transition Rules

#### Automatic Transitions
1. **Pending → Ready**: When all readiness criteria are met
2. **Pending → Past Due**: When target_date < today and not ready
3. **Ready → Past Due**: When target_date < today (if readiness criteria become unmet)

#### Manual Transitions
1. **Any State → Complete**: Release manager action (deployment)
2. **Any State → Cancelled**: Release manager action
3. **Complete/Cancelled → Any State**: Not allowed (archived)

### "Next Release" Logic

**Definition**: `MIN(target_date)` where `target_date ≥ today` AND state ≠ `cancelled`

**Display Priority**:
1. Past Due releases (highest priority)
2. Pending releases (by target_date ascending)
3. Ready releases (by target_date ascending)

### Readiness Calculation Rules

#### Team Readiness
- **Definition**: All team members marked as ready
- **Calculation**: `COUNT(ready_members) = COUNT(total_members)` for each team

#### Feature Readiness
- **Definition**: All features marked as ready by their DRIs
- **Calculation**: `COUNT(ready_features) = COUNT(total_features)`

#### Release Readiness
- **Definition**: All teams ready AND all features ready
- **Formula**: `ALL(teams_ready) AND ALL(features_ready)`

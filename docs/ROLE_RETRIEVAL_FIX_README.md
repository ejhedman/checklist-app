# Role Retrieval Issues Fix

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the multiple role fetching and wrong role assignment issues.

## Issues Identified

1. **Multiple Role Fetching**: The role was being fetched multiple times due to race conditions in the AuthContext
2. **Wrong Role Assignment**: The fallback mechanism was returning 'user' role on any error instead of failing properly
3. **Database Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent RLS policies and table structure
4. **State Management Issues**: Poor state management leading to duplicate API calls

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. AuthContext Improvements (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Removed the problematic fallback mechanism that returned 'user' on errors
- Added proper promise-based state management using `useRef` to prevent duplicate fetches
- Improved error handling to throw errors instead of silently failing
- Added better logging for debugging
- Increased timeout from 3 to 5 seconds for role fetching

**Key Improvements:**
- `roleFetchPromise` ref prevents multiple simultaneous fetches for the same user
- `lastFetchedUserId` ref tracks which user's role was last fetched
- Proper error propagation instead of fallback to 'user' role
- Better race condition handling

### 2. Database Fixes (`database/fix_role_retrieval_issues.sql`)

**Changes Made:**
- Recreated the `user_roles` table with proper structure
- Set up correct RLS policies that allow users to read their own role
- Ensured ehedman@acm.org has admin role
- Created helper functions for role management
- Added comprehensive verification queries

**Key Features:**
- Proper RLS policies: users can only read their own role
- Automatic admin role assignment for ehedman@acm.org
- Bootstrap all other users with 'user' role
- Helper functions for role management

### 3. Diagnostic Tools (`database/diagnose_role_issues.sql`)

**Purpose:**
- Comprehensive diagnostic script to identify current database state
- Helps troubleshoot any remaining issues
- Provides detailed information about user roles and permissions

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Apply Database Fixes

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the comprehensive fix script:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of database/fix_role_retrieval_issues.sql
   ```

4. Verify the fix worked by running the diagnostic script:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of database/diagnose_role_issues.sql
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

The AuthContext changes are already applied to the codebase. Deploy your application with the updated code.

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. Clear your browser's local storage and cookies
2. Log in as ehedman@acm.org
3. Check the browser console for role fetching logs
4. Verify that:
   - Role is only fetched once
   - The correct 'admin' role is assigned
   - No fallback to 'user' role occurs

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:
- Multiple role fetch attempts in console logs
- Incorrect 'user' role assigned to ehedman@acm.org
- Fallback to 'user' role on any error

### After Fix:
- Single role fetch per user session
- Correct 'admin' role for ehedman@acm.org
- Proper error handling without fallbacks
- Clear console logs showing the role fetching process

## Console Log Examples

### Successful Role Fetch:
```
üöÄ AUTH CONTEXT INITIALIZING...
üìã GETTING INITIAL SESSION...
üë§ SESSION USER FOUND, FETCHING ROLE ONCE...
üîç FETCHING USER ROLE - User ID: [user-id]
‚úÖ ROLE FETCHED SUCCESSFULLY: admin for user: [user-id]
‚úÖ INITIAL ROLE SET: admin
‚úÖ AUTH INITIALIZATION COMPLETE
```

### Error Handling (No Fallback):
```
üîç FETCHING USER ROLE - User ID: [user-id]
‚ùå ROLE FETCH ERROR: [specific error message]
‚ùå ROLE FETCH EXCEPTION: [error details]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Role Still Shows as 'user':

1. Run the diagnostic script to check database state
2. Verify ehedman@acm.org exists in auth.users
3. Check if the user has a role in user_roles table
4. Verify RLS policies are correct

### If Multiple Fetches Still Occur:

1. Check browser console for the new logging
2. Verify the AuthContext changes are deployed
3. Clear browser cache and local storage
4. Check for any other components that might be calling useAuth()

### If Database Errors Occur:

1. Check Supabase logs for specific error messages
2. Verify the user_roles table was created properly
3. Check RLS policies and permissions
4. Ensure the user exists in auth.users table

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback by:

1. Reverting the AuthContext.tsx changes
2. Running the original database setup scripts
3. Restoring the fallback mechanism (though not recommended)

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. Browser console logs for role fetching behavior
2. Database queries for role retrieval
3. User experience with role-based features
4. Any error logs in Supabase

## Support

If you encounter issues after applying these fixes:

1. Run the diagnostic script and share the results
2. Check browser console logs
3. Verify the database state
4. Contact the development team with specific error messages
